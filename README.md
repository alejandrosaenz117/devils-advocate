## What's Inside

### The Devil's Advocate

The tenth man. When consensus forms, it is a sign of danger. This plugin peers into the fog where failure waits. The collapse. The breach. The systems failing under weight they cannot see. It reveals where light fails and why the walls will break.

**Invoke:** Mention "adversarial review" or "challenge the plan" as a skill, or use `/devils-advocate [file|description|recent]` command.

See [plugins/devils-advocate/README.md](plugins/devils-advocate/README.md) for full documentation.

## Philosophy

See the darkness before it sees you. Challenge consensus. Find what will break before you go hollow.
