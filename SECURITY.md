# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

Found a vulnerability in The Devil's Advocate itself? (e.g., a prompt injection technique to bypass the mandate, or a method to make it produce LGTM responses)

**Do not open a public GitHub issue.** Report privately instead:

1. Go to the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/alejandrosaenz117/devils-advocate/security) tab
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Describe the vulnerability and how to reproduce it
4. Include proof of concept if possible

If you find a vulnerability in Claude Code itself or the Claude API, report it to Anthropic security directly.
